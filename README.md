## HeatMap Visualizations Explained

This document describes three types of heatmaps used to visualize your gitlab project structure and last blame using sunburst diagrams. Each version offers a distinct way to explore the contents of a codebase.


### 1. Simple Heatmap

This version displays a basic sunburst view of the project.

**Create it using:**

```smalltalk
sb := Design new.
sbCanva := sb SunburstFor: nodesTree withLeafs: #subFoldersOrFile.
sbCanva canvas
```

**Features**:

+ Click on any node to view details about that folder or file.

+ Each file node includes:
    + ``name``
    + ``changed`` (last modification date from Git blame)
    + ``fullpath``
    + ``color`` (visual indicator, e.g., based on changes)
    + ``changedBy`` (author of last change)
    + ``srcNode`` (parent package)

**Example:**

### 2. Insider Heatmap
This version is designed for easier navigation in large projects by limiting the visible depth.

**Create it using:**

```smalltalk
sb := Design new.
sbCanva := sb SunburstFor: nodesTree withLeafs: #subFoldersOrFile maxDepth: 2.
sbCanva canvas
```
**Features**:

+ The maxDepth parameter sets how many layers are initially shown.
+ Clicking on a node zooms into that section and regenerates the sunburst with the clicked node as the new root.
+ This allows focused exploration without overwhelming the view.
+ Same informations for files and folders as Simple Heatmap

**Example:**

### 3. Dynamic Heatmap
This is the most scalable version and is suitable for large codebases.

**Create it using:**

```smalltalk
sb:= Design new.
sbCanva := sb DynamicSunburstFor: nodesTree withLeafs: #subFoldersOrFile.
sbCanva canvas.
```

**Features**:

+ Begins as a simple sunburst.
+ Clicking a node sets it as the new root, allowing for detailed exploration.
+ To return to the previous view, click the center node.
+ Same informations for files and folders as Simple Heatmap

**Example:**
